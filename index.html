			<h1>What is Bernoulli's Equation?</h1>
			<p>This website will take you through how the Bernoulli's equation is derived through multiple simulations. At the end, you will be able to test your knowledge through a game</p>
			<p>Bernoulli's Equation assumes a lot of things. For one thing, this only works with steady-state flow, which means that the velocity of the fluid is the same for each molecule in each cross section. Another assumption is that there is no fluid friction. This is a reasonable assumption for fluids with low viscosities like water, blood, or alcohol. However, fluids with higher viscosities will resist motion more, like honey.</p>
